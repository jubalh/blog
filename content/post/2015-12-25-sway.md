This post is about being cutting edge.

Some friends of mine use Ubuntu, because they think it is stable. Others use arch because they think it is cutting edge.
I get both, with openSUSE. If I want to have a stable system I run openSUSE Leap 42.1, with its SLE base its a really nice fit. If I want to play around with newest program I run openSUSE Tumbleweed, the rolling release version of openSUSE.

There was a time when I used [i3](https://i3wm.org/), vim and dmenu on my main machine, currently I run mostly GNOME 3. But for the minimalists + always-wanting-the-newest-ishes out there I would like to show you my experimental setup.

Most have heard that Wayland will replace X in the future. i3 is a X window manager only so far. Some people started [sway](http://swaywm.org/) to have it on Wayland. Instead of dmenu I switched to [rofi](https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/) already some time ago. I also maintain the openSUSE package for it. It's not just an application launcher, it can also be used to switch windows and quickly connect to other machines over SSH.

Another new thing is about the editor. Personally I still use *vim* but many people report that [neovim](https://neovim.io/) works flawlessly now. Also there came a new kid to the block called [kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/) which tries to be a *better code editor*. It sais it needs less key strokes than vim for most operations. For me this is not really a big criteria but it is an interesting project nevertheless. So I created the openSUSE package to. Sway, rofi as well as neovim and kakoune can be found in openSUSE repositories. Most are in the official Tumbleweed repos but neovim needs to be added from user repository.

For me the setup is quite nice to play around with. rofi works perfectly as does neovim. With kakoune I only played a little but sway, or more likelye, the programs running in the Wayland session create some trouble.

Here you can see rofi in **run** mode. So it starts an application. You can either start it via `rofi -show run` or `rofi -key-run F2` to launch it in run mode. The first command will just launch rofi, the second will make it pop up every time you press *F2* or whatever key you specify there.
To change modes either launch it in the **window** or **ssh** mode, or press *shift + arrow right* or *ctrl + tab*. to switch through the modes.

**Run** mode will either launch the application or launch it in terminal if you press *shift + enter*. Previously it used *x-terminal-emulator* to determine the terminal but I started an [discussion](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/pull/201) to change that.

**SSH** mode lets you select a host from the list you defined in `~/.ssh/config`.

**Window** mode just lets you switch between windows.

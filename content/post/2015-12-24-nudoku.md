I know: Every computer kid has the deep desire to write a curses based
application at least once in a lifetime.  Of course, being on terminal is just
cool. The clean and minimalistic environment. Knowing that every computer can
handle your challenging and artful graphics is deeply satisfactioning too. Like
that you will never exclude anybody from using your awesome application.  And
of course, growing up with text based interfaces it brings to mind warm
childhood memories.

So yeah. I wanted to write a pretty text based application since, well, since
alyways. I even started several attempts, creating prototypes for different
programs. However all the time it was a too ambiguous goal, since everybody
unfortunately has limited free time.

A couple of weeks ago I was ill, resting on the couch while listening to some
audio book and playing Sudoku.  Indeed, it was pretty comfortable. On the next
day, I knew what text based application I would do, and this time I would
finish it. Not too demanding and quite some fun.

Thus I got out my laptop and started hacking away on *nudoku* - *n*curses based
s*udoku* game.

I learned quite a lot with this little project

* first I had to learn *ncurses* I had to learn more about *Makefile* and
* *autotools* Write a man page

For which I used:

- http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/
- http://inti.sourceforge.net/tutorial/libinti/autotoolsproject.html
- https://autotools.io/autoconf/index.html
- https://blog.flameeyes.eu/tag/autoconf#gsc.tab=0
- http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/books/autotools_a_guide_to_autoconf_automake_libtool
- https://bitbucket.org/mgorny/pshs/src

Once a playable prototype I took the chance to learn to write Ebuilds and
creating an Overlay of my own by writing the [nudoku 0.1 beta
ebuild](https://github.com/jubalh/strangeland-overlay/blob/master/games-puzzle/nudoku/nudoku-0.1_beta.ebuild)
and adding it to my own [strangeland
overlay](https://github.com/jubalh/strangeland-overlay).

For this I read:

- http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Basic_guide_to_write_Gentoo_Ebuilds
- https://devmanual.gentoo.org/quickstart/
- http://devmanual.gentoo.org/
- http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/www-servers/pshs/pshs-9999.ebuild?view=markup

A nice hint on how to handle a tarball with a different name and learn about
Gentoo version scheme naming came from **Pinkbyte** in *#gentoo-dev* by pointing
me to `dev-ml/gd4o/gd4o-1.0_alpha5.ebuild`.

Later I also had to read the [GitHub article on how to create
releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and learn more
about eautoreconf.

Fast forward.

[Nudoku](https://github.com/jubalh/nudoku) now has its own [website](http://jubalh.github.io/nudoku/) and is
installable via package manager in openSUSE, Gentoo, Funtoo and Arch Linux.
The funny thing is that I found out that a YouTube user named **Yu-Jie Lin**, who
seems to be a cli fanatic, even made a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-NQcfM9cpk) featuring a very early
version of nudoku, before I even talked about nudoku to anybody and just pushed
it to GitHub!

To install nudoku on openSUSE Tumbleweed a simple `zypper in nudoku` is enough on other versions you might have to add the `games` repository first:

```
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games/openSUSE_Leap_42.1/games.repo
zypper refresh
zypper in nudoku
```

To learn to use it just play it or read `man nudoku.`

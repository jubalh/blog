I store most of my configuration files publicly on GitHub. However there are some programs which contain passwords in their config files, among these are irssi, Pidgin and osc. It was very annoying to always configure those programs from the start on each computer. So today I took the time and created a small server out of an old netbook. I switch it on on days I know I need a service on it and leave it off if I don&rsquo;t.

Okay, going to explain how to install and enable ssh on your openSUSE box here. Some people didn&rsquo;t seem to get it to work altough there is an older article describing how to do it with SysVInit. My article will have the same format just with the new commands. On the openSUSE wiki they explain it via yast. Check if package is installed: zypper if openssh Install package if it isn&rsquo;t installed: zypper in openssh Check if ssh server is running: systemctl status sshd Start service: systemctl start sshd vs rcsshdstart?

The Fritz!Box is really a very usable device. And I am quite happy that it is pretty common and many people have it. Here I describe which features I especially like and use. Accessing the Fritz!Box The easiest way to configure it is probably accessing it via your browser, just navigate to either http://192.168.178.1/ or http://fritz.box/. Sometimes I have not set up correctly DNS properly because I have a half-ass configured VPN running on one of my laptops and then I have to use the IP insteda of the domain name.

I wanted to learn Go. But as everybody knows, I need do use something to learn how to use it. After a while reading articles and watching talks about Go I started to think about what I could do, and what I did, was creating (a) tongue. I like learning languages, yeah, human languages that is. Unfortunately I am not able to speak any single one except my native language to a good level but I like it anyways.

<h2><a href="http://jubalh.github.io/blog/post/2014-12-13-devlxqttoo/">LXQt development on Funtoo </a> </h2>
<div class="post-meta">Sat, Dec 13, 2014 - Read in 4 Min </div>
</header>
This post is about making Funtoo/Gentoo ready for developing on LXQt or just have the latest version installed for testing. Some people came with questions about this to the #lxde IRC channel, and since most of the LXQt developers run Arch Linux there is not always somebody online who can help with Gentoo questions. Note: I am doing this on Funtoo, but will use &ldquo;Gentoo&rdquo; from now on since it is the same procedure for both.

<div class="post-meta">Thu, Sep 4, 2014 - Read in 3 Min </div>

Since March 2014 I am running Funtoo Linux on one of my main machines. It&rsquo;s a great distribution, I learn a lot while using it. Updating always went smoothly until yesterday, when I had troubles for the first time. I started my computer after the update and couldn&rsquo;t connect through to my wifi anymore. I wondered what was the reason but didn&rsquo;t find it fast enough, because I had to go to work.

<h2><a href="http://jubalh.github.io/blog/post/2014-08-15-opensource/">Participate in open source </a> </h2>

On twitter and on some blogs there are quite some people describing themselves as open source evangelists and stuff like that. Some of whom I know personally. And all they do is running around and talking about how great open source is. Mostly because, they don&rsquo;t have to pay money for using software. Which undoubtedly is a valid reason, but not the only one. Anyway I would appreciate if they would go deeper into the subject and inform themselves about the philosophy behind Free Software, participate in open source either by writing code, creating artwork, translating or creating documentation instead of only spreading the word.

Through a tweet, I stumbled upon cool-old-term, a terminal emulator with the looks of an old cathode tube screen realized with QML. It was a funny idea and because I wrote a small QML Hello World example once, but didn&rsquo;t dig deeper into QML,I decided to check out the sourcecode and give it a look. But again, I didnt&rsquo;t spent much time reading the QML but rather looked at the C++ terminal plugin behind cool-old-term.

When I moved here to start going to university, I searched for interesting companies to work for. One of them stated on their website that they use the symfony2 PHP framework.&rdquo; I have never done much in the web area, but have always been interested in getting started. Because I was totally in exam period I rather should have studied, but decided to give symfony a quick look. Somfonys website is excellent.

In A Galaxy Far, Far Away or, how everything started In this first Post I would like to tell you how my journey into the world of computers began. I think I was something between 10 to 12 years old when I watched the older brother of a friend playing a text based computer game in fullscreen console on Windows 95. &ldquo;Why do you play a game like that? Why not play one which has graphics?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Because we wrote this game ourselves&rdquo; &ldquo;Wrote?&rdquo; So it came that one week later my friend brought a floppy to class with the words: &ldquo;Here you have it.
